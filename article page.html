   <p>Linus Torvalds (born December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland) is a Finnish-American software engineer and the creator of the Linux kernel, the core of the Linux operating system. He began programming at age 10, fueled by his grandfather's Commodore VIC-20. While studying computer science at the University of Helsinki, he became dissatisfied with the MS-DOS operating system on his PC and decided to create a UNIX-like alternative, which he named Linux. He released the source code freely, fostering a collaborative open-source development model that has made Linux one of the most popular operating systems in the world. </p>
